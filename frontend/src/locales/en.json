    "discription": "Dino Dodgeball is a game I created alongside my friends for a project. It was a fun project for me and my friends brainstorming ideas on how to implement serious games. This game was made with kids in mind who face challenges in spelling and using words. Here, I learned how to use Blender and Unity for the first time, and that’s how I came up with creating Dino, the flying dinosaur (and no, he’s not a dragon). The story behind it is that Dino, the protagonist, was playing dodgeball with his girlfriend when suddenly, evil enemies kidnapped her. Now Dino has to play dodgeball against them. Every time you (the player) spell a word correctly, you help Dino win and get closer to freeing his girlfriend and their egg. Otherwise, Dino loses, and the game sadly would be over :,( Please feel free to click the link, download the game, explore, and have fun; hopefully as much as we did creating it!",

    "discription": "Idi.ba was my first look into software engineering. The course was taught by an industry expert, and the aim of the project was to encourage students to innovate and learn. This project was my first window into industry-like style programming: learning coding ethics, file management, and more. Idi.ba was an idea created based on the need and convenience of bringing carpooling to Bosnian cities such as Sarajevo. The website was also adapted to the local language. It was built using Java Spring and Angular. In the end, through this website, I learned the ethics of programming and software engineering , and my love for it grew through this project.",

  "dogbone": {
    "discription": "PAWS was my first web project and my first proper look into software and product development. I really loved how it brought out the creative side of me. Through this project, I first learned how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. PAWS was a project designed to let people adopt animals from shelters through our service. In front of you is the website header, shaped like a dog bone. It might not look that special to you, but to me, it really proved that I could code anything — even a dog bone — as a beginner. So please enjoy a part of my website that, at the time, made me feel so proud and confident — like I could do anything after coding that XD.
